🧠 MIPS Assembly Language Labs (3rd Semester)

This repository contains my MIPS Assembly Language lab tasks and practice exercises, developed during my 3rd semester as part of the Computer Architecture / Assembly Language Programming course.
All programs are written and executed using the MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) framework.

🧩 Overview

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate low-level programming concepts using MIPS Assembly, focusing on:

Understanding CPU architecture and instruction execution

Learning register-level programming

Implementing arithmetic, logical, and branching operations

Exploring memory management and system calls

Each lab contains MIPS .asm files with comments explaining logic and functionality.

🧪 Topics Covered
Lab No.	Topic	Description
01	Basic I/O	Displaying text, taking user input, and basic system calls
02	Arithmetic Operations	Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using registers
03	Conditional Branching	Using beq, bne, and comparison logic
04	Loops	Implementing for, while, and do-while structures in assembly
05	Arrays and Memory	Working with arrays, loading/storing data, and memory addressing
06	Procedures & Functions	Using jal, jr, and stack operations for subroutines
07	Strings & System Calls	String manipulation and I/O operations
08	Final Task / Project	A complete MIPS program combining multiple concepts
⚙️ Tools & Requirements

MARS IDE (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator)

Java Runtime Environment (JRE) — required to run MARS

Basic knowledge of Assembly Language, registers, and instruction sets

🚀 How to Run

Download and open MARS.jar

Open any .asm file from this repository

Assemble and run using:

Assemble → F3

Go / Run → F5

Check the Console / Run I/O window for output
